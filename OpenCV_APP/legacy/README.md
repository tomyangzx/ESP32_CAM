# Legacy Files

This directory is reserved for original/legacy OpenCV application files.

When migrating existing code to the new structure, place the original files here for reference.

## Purpose

- Maintain backward compatibility
- Provide reference during migration
- Preserve historical implementations

## Note

The new refactored code is in the parent directories. This directory should only contain reference files.
